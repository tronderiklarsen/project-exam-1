        <h1>About the ISS</h1>
        <p>
          The International Space Station is a large spacecraft in orbit around
          Earth. It serves as a home where crews of astronauts and cosmonauts
          live. The space station is also a unique science laboratory. Several
          nations worked together to build and use the space station. The space
          station is made of parts that were assembled in space by astronauts.
          It orbits Earth at an average altitude of approximately 402 km. It
          travels at 4,66 km/s. This means it orbits Earth every 90 minutes.
          NASA is using the space station to learn more about living and working
          in space. These lessons will make it possible to send humans farther
          into space than ever before.

        <h2>How Old Is the Space Station?</h2>
        <p>
          The first piece of the International Space Station was launched in
          November 1998. A Russian rocket launched the Russian Zarya (zar EE uh)
          control module. About two weeks later, the space shuttle Endeavour met
          Zarya in orbit. The space shuttle was carrying the U.S. Unity node.
          The crew attached the Unity node to Zarya. More pieces were added over
          the next two years before the station was ready for people to live
          there. The first crew arrived on November 2, 2000. People have lived
          on the space station ever since. More pieces have been added over
          time. NASA and its partners from around the world completed
          construction of the space station in 2011.
